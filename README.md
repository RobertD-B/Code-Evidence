# Code-Evidence
This is a repository of code that I have produced in R.
Assignment 2 - full code was created for an assignment in my Year in Data Analytics, Big Data and Machine Learning module. I used the Adult (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult) data set and fitted a Random Forest and a Generalised Boosted Model with the training set.
